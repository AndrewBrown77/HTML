# Planters

## Description: 
A basic website about plants, built with HTML and CSS, could feature a clean and welcoming homepage with a title like "Welcome to the World of Plants." The site could include sections such as "About Plants," "Types of Plants," and "Care Tips," each presented in separate HTML <div> elements styled with CSS. The design could use a natural color scheme, such as greens and browns, with a header showcasing a banner image of a lush garden. Each section could feature images of plants with descriptive text underneath, arranged in a responsive grid layout. A simple navigation bar at the top would allow users to browse the sections smoothly, while a footer with links to resources and contact information completes the layout. The site would be lightweight, visually pleasing, and easy to navigate, providing essential information about plants to beginners and enthusiasts alike.
